This may not be the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework!
For something in between [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [karpathy/micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
tinygrad will always be below 1000 lines.
If it isn't, we will revert commits until it becomes smaller.
Due to its extreme simplicity, it aims to be the easiest framework to add new accelerators to, with support for both inference and training.
