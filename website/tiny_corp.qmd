The tiny corp can help!
We can port our framework to any accelerator.
We write and maintain [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad), the fastest growing neural network framework (almost 9000 GitHub stars)!
tinygrad is extremely simple, and breaks down the most [complex](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion.py) networks into 4 [OpTypes](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/ops.py):

1. **UnaryOps**, operate on one tensor and run element-wise (RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc.),
1. **BinaryOps**, operate on two tensors and run element-wise to return one (ADD, MUL, etc.),
1. **ReduceOps**, operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor (SUM, MAX etc.) and also
1. **MovementOps**, operate on one tensor and move data, copy-free with [ShapeTracker](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/shapetracker.py) .

But how? Where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the [code](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) to solve this mystery!
